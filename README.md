This is my personal website. It is a simple static HTML site hosted on Netlify.

## Structure

- `content/`: Contains the website content (HTML, CSS, images).
- `netlify.toml`: Configuration for Netlify deployment.

## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to Netlify on every push to the `master` branch.
